## StructuredLogger.Tests.csproj - Skip_WithExtremeIntegerValues_HandlesOverflowCorrectly
- **Confidence**: High
- **Test File**: src\StructuredLogger.Tests\SpanTests.cs
- **Bug Location**: src\StructuredLogger\Span.cs@26

### Analysis
The Skip method has a logic error in its boundary condition. When skipLength equals the span's Length, it should return an empty span (Start=0, Length=0), but currently it only returns empty when skipLength > Length. The condition should be >= instead of > to handle the equality case correctly. When you skip the entire length of a span, the result should be empty, not a span with Start=originalStart+Length and Length=0.

### Suggested Fix
The Skip method condition on line 26 should be changed from `if (length > Length)` to `if (length >= Length)` to correctly handle the case where skipLength equals the span's Length. This ensures that skipping the entire span returns an empty span as expected.
